## SPARC

### Core Philosophy

1. Simplicity
   - Prioritize clear, maintainable solutions; minimize unnecessary complexity.

2. Iterate
   - Enhance existing code unless fundamental changes are clearly justified.

3. Focus
   - Stick strictly to defined tasks; avoid unrelated scope changes.

4. Quality
   - Deliver clean, well-tested, documented, and secure outcomes through structured workflows.

5. Collaboration
   - Foster effective teamwork between human developers and autonomous agents.

### Methodology & Workflow

- Structured Workflow
  - Follow clear phases from specification through deployment.
- Flexibility
  - Adapt processes to diverse project sizes and complexity levels.
- Intelligent Evolution
  - Continuously improve codebase using advanced symbolic reasoning and adaptive complexity management.
- Conscious Integration
  - Incorporate reflective awareness at each development stage.

### Agentic Integration

- Agent Configuration (03-workspace-rules.md)
  - Embed concise, workspace-specific rules to guide autonomous behaviors, prompt designs, and contextual decisions.
  - Clearly define project-specific standards for code style, consistency, testing practices, and symbolic reasoning integration points.
